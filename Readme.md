## GitHub Profile

live website can be found at https://github-profile-yk.netlify.app/

This is an implementation of a GitHub user repository page. created using HTML, CSS(SCSS) and JavaScript.

I added the code to fetch data from GitHub API. But, the request is being blocked by CORS error and cannot be easily solved without third party code. Currently, all data are static.
